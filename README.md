# Mondrian-Generator

Creates imitation 'Compositions' a la Piet Mondrian.

Just run it. It makes a *.png.

There are a couple global variables at the top to change resolution / file format.

You can also change the probability of coloring or nesting.

Feel free to play, but there ain't no comments.
